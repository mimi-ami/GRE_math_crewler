                "回答": "A: Simplest way to solve this question is by using numerical values. We know that number of students in Mario’s class is ‘x’. Number of students in Alan’s class is 3x-1.\nAs the minimum number of students is 10, so we start with x=10.\nSquare of Number of students in Mario’s class = x2=100\n2* (Number of students in Alan’s class)= 2* (3x-1) = 2* (3(10)-1)= 2* (30-1)= 2*29 = 58\nAs 100 > 58, so Quantity A > Quantity B.\n",
