D, E and F: The price of one pencil is given as 50 cents each. If we sell ‘k’ pencils, the revenue generated would be 50k. From the condition given in the question,
50k ≥ (498 + 0.2k)
49.8k ≥ 498
K ≥ 10.
Therefore, in order to get revenue, equal to or greater than our manufacturing cost, we must sell at least 10 pencils.
