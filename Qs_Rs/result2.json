Each of these 20 chits has a number written on it from 1 to 20 and no number is repeated twice. The one who picks up a chit which is either multiple of 5 or 6 will have to serve others a smoked chicken pizza. Bale tries his luck first. What is the probability that he will be the one who will have to serve other pizza?\nAnswer as a fraction in simplest form (e.g., 1/4 or 3/5)",
